A FIRST WORKBOOK OF ENGLISH




PREFACE
The workbook exercises are graded to confirm and support the sentence sequences in the first 121 pages of the text. They apply the teaching of vocabulary and structure in simple problem situations which beginners in English can solve, stage by stage, for themselves. They may then check their growing competence by the answers provided.

The workbook should be used without recourse to expla- nations other than the pictures and examples provided, and the text of English Through Pictures Book 1, which it follows. Teachers using the materials with classes will get the best results if they refrain from the use of translation and bilingual dictionaries. Simple demonstrations of the sentence situations presented in the book can readily be made with the help of objects and pictures. Students can be induced to act out the meaning of what they are saying when they are placed in the carefully designed situations that the text provides. Adequate study of these sentence situations will prepare them to solve these workbook problems with enjoyment.

When John Smith came to the door of his house, he put his hand in his coat pocket. There was a knife in his pocket, but there was no key.
　“Where is my key?” he said. “It is not in my pocket. It was in this pocket. Now there is a knife in this pocket, but there is no key.” He put his hand in the other pockets of his coat, but there was no key in  them.
　“Mary has a key,” he said, “but Mary is not here. She will be here at 5:00. Now it is 3:00. From 3:00 to 5:00 is a long time.”
　Mr. Smith went from the door of his house to the front window. The window was shut. He went to one side of the house and to the back of the house and to the other side of the house. All the windows were shut. Then he came to the front of the house again.
　“I will take my open knife and see what it will do,” he said. He went to the front window and put the thin part


of his knife under it. The window went up an inch. Then he put his fingers under the window and gave a push. Now the window was open. Mr. Smith put one leg and then the other through the open   window.
“Now I am in the house,” he said.
　He was out of breath. He went to a seat. There was a man’s coat over the back of the seat.“Here is my other coat,” said Mr. Smith.“Is my key in one of the pockets of this coat? I will see.”
　The coat had four pockets. Mr. Smith put his hand in three of the pockets. No key! When he put his hand in the other pocket, there it was. Mr. Smith took the key out of the pocket and said, “Now I have my key. It was there all the time!”

What are these men and boys doing? The two men are on their knees doing something to a boy who is face down. One of these men took the boy from the water after seeing him go under. The man went in after him with all his clothing on.
　Now they are turning the boy over.“See, his eyes are shut,” some of the other boys say.
　“Keep back, will you,” says the man who went into the water, putting out an arm and pushing them back. “He has to have air.”


　“We’ve got all the water out of him,” says the other man,“but he isn’t breathing, or is he?”
　He puts his ear to the boy’s chest. “No,” he says. “He isn’t breathing.”
　Now one man is opening the boy’s mouth and the other is putting his mouth to the boy’s mouth. He is breathing air into the boy. He is making his breath go in and out of the boy. He does this again and again.
“Give me a glass, someone,” he is saying now.
　A man is taking his glasses off his nose and handing them to him.
　“Good! These will do,” he says, taking them and putting one glass in front of the boy’s   mouth.
　“Is he breathing?” says the man who took the boy from the water.“Yes, he is. See!”
　They see the boy’s breath on the glass. He is breathing again. He is going to be all right. The air is going in and out of his chest.
They got him out of the water in  time.
