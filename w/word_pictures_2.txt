The moon and the earth are not very far from one another.
The distance between them is about two hundred and thirty-nine thousand (239,000) miles.

Because they are great bodies and near one another, the attraction between the moon and the earth is very great. Why does the moon not come down to the earth? That is a question.



The answer is:“Because it is going round the earth.”

I keep the end of the cord in my hand.

Now I let the end of the cord in my hand go.









The weight goes off in a straight line. It takes the cord with it.



The pull of the cord in my hand kept the
weight from going off in a straight line.

The attraction between the earth and the moon keeps the moon from going off in a straight line.

Here is Sir Isaac Newton, the great man of science. Newton had a great mind.

He is under an apple tree.

It is the year 1666.

Those are apples which are over his head.

The seat has three legs.





.................................................... .

Here is an apple which was over his head. The apple was on a branch of the tree.

The apple came off the branch. It came down.










It came down on Newton’s head.



That is the story.
The story may be true or it may not be true.







But that is the story. It comes from the great writer, Voltaire.

True?
2 + 2 = 4. That is true.
2 + 2 = 5. That is not true. It is a false statement. “Apples are fruit.”
That statement is true. “Apples are animals.” That statement is false. False = not true
Short = not long Shut = not open



.................................................... .


In this story the fall of the apple on Newton’s head was the cause of the idea.

The blow which the apple gave to Newton’s head gave an idea to Newton.
It made a question come into Newton’s mind.



This was the question: “Have the fall of the apple and the motion of the moon the same cause?”


Here is a ball. It is hanging on a  cord.






I will give a blow to the ball with this stick.

I gave the blow. Now the ball is in motion. What was the cause of the motion? The blow of the stick was the cause of the motion.



.................................................... .
The ball was not in motion before the blow. It was at rest. It was hanging on the end of the cord.





The blow was the cause of the motion.

After the blow the ball was in motion.
The motion came from the blow.
The motion was the effect of the blow.

What is this?








The man has an umbrella in his hand.
It is open.
He has it over his head. Why?


Because it is raining. Water is coming down from the sky.
The water is rain. Rain is coming down. Rain is falling.
It is raining.

.................................................... .


The rain made the man put up his umbrella.
That was the effect of the rain.
Today is Monday. Yesterday (Sunday) the sun was bright.
There were no clouds in the sky.

Today there are dark clouds in the sky.
They come between us and the sun.
The dark clouds keep the light of the sun from us.



The rain comes down from the clouds on me. It comes down on my head.

The rain comes down from the clouds on us. It comes down on our heads.











.................................................... .

Why is it raining today? Yesterday the weather was good.
The sun was bright. The air was warm.

Today the weather is bad.
The rain is coming down. The wind is blowing.
It is cold and the rain makes us wet.


Tomorrow the weather may be worse. It may be very cold.
All the water may be ice.
Snow may be coming down making everything white. Will tomorrow be like this?
Is this winter or summer?








.................................................... .

Or tomorrow the weather may be better. The sun may be bright  again.
The air may be warm again and the streets may be dry again.
Will tomorrow be like this?



What are the causes of these changes in the weather? Change? What is that? (See page 70.)



Here is a line.



Here is a change in the direction of the line.

This bird was wet. It was in the rain.

That is a change.
It was wet. It is dry.

.................................................... .

What is the cause of these changes in the weather?


Good	Bad
Dry	Wet
Warm	Cold Weather



Why are there these changes of weather?

There is not one cause only.
There are numbers of causes.
Changes in the heat which comes to us from the sun
are one cause of changes of weather.



The amount of heat which the earth gets from the sun is different from time to time.
There are changes in the sun.

If you take a look at the sun through a bit of dark glass you may see small marks on the face of
the sun.









.................................................... .


Amount? One dollar is a small amount of money. A million dollars is a great amount of  money.
A drop of rain is a very small
amount of water.


There is a small amount of water in this glass.

There is a great amount of water in the sea.
This is the sea.
Those are ships which are on the sea.



Changes in the heat which comes to the earth from the sun are one cause of changes in the weather.
This discovery is new.  A man of science made the discovery in 1944.

He made it by measuring the heat which comes to the earth every day from the sun.
The amount of heat is different from day to day.








.................................................... .

On some days the sun sends more heat to the earth. On other days it sends less heat to the earth.



There is more water in this glass than in that.


More	Less

We are making new discoveries every day. Columbus made the discovery of America in 1492.
Columbus came to America in his ship in 1492.



What were some other great discoveries?
One of them was fire.


Smoke

Another great discovery was the wheel.

A cart

They are of very great use to us.


.................................................... .


Another great discovery was clothing.




What are these? These are some other sorts of clothing.




A skirt	A shirt

The making of cloth was a great discovery. This is how we make cloth.






These are threads. (See page 47.)
They go across from one side to the other of a frame.



These are other threads.






They go across the first threads.



They go under and over them.

This is cloth.







This is a roll of cloth. We make clothing of cloth. We make cloth of threads.

.................................................... .

We get wool from sheep.

Wool is the thick warm hair of sheep.
We take the wool off the sheep’s back with scissors.



We make threads from the wool by twisting the hairs round and round.
That wheel is going round.
It is giving a twist to the thread.
It is twisting the thread.

We get cotton from the cotton plant.






Cotton is the soft white hair round the seeds of the plant.




.................................................... .


These are different sorts of seeds.


Plants come up from seeds which come from other plants of the same sort.

We get silk from the silkworm.





This worm makes a soft strong thread of silk and puts it round itself like
a coat.



Wool, cotton, and silk are different sorts of cloth. We make clothing of all these sorts of cloth.

When the weather is cold we put on thick warm wool clothing. When the weather is warm we put on thin cotton clothing. Cotton clothing is not as warm as wool clothing.








.................................................... .
Thick clothing keeps us warm.
It keeps us warmer than thin clothing.
Thick cloth keeps air in it,

between the threads. The air does not let heat go through it.

A thick roof keeps the heat of the house in.
A thin roof lets the heat go through it.



A thick roof keeps the heat of the sun out.



Here is a pencil. It is straight.
It is not bent.

Before I put the pencil in the water it seemed straight.
It was straight.

After I put it in the water it seemed bent. It wasn’t bent.


When it is in the water it seems bent.

When it is out of the water we see that it is straight.



.................................................... .
Why did it seem bent when it was in the water?






This is a light.
A light sends out light. The light which it sends out goes in straight lines.


Here is a bit of glass. A ray of light is going through the glass.



Where the light goes into the glass, it is bent.







It is bent again where it comes out of the glass into the air.

Here is your eye.

.................................................... .


The light from the pencil is bent where it comes out of the water into the air.









It is bent here.

The pencil is not bent.
But the light from it is bent.










The light comes from here.

But it seems to come from here.


The part of the pencil which is under the water seems to be where it
is not.

Put your fingers across one another like this.









I have my first and second fingers across one another.

Across?
These two lines
go across one another.


My second finger is over and across my first finger.

 These are finger nails.

.................................................... .


Did you put your fingers across one another?
That is right.
You have your fingers across one another.

Now take a pencil and give a touch to one finger, and then a touch to the other and then put the pencil between them. Do this with your eyes shut.



You will have a strange feeling.
Are two pencils touching your fingers, or is only one pencil touching them?

Do you have the strange feeling that two pencils are there?
When you are touching one finger only, you seem to be touching the other?








.................................................... .
Why is that? Here is the answer.









When the fingers are like this, or like this, they do their work together.

Seeing and hearing and touch are three of
our senses.
We get knowledge through our eyes (see- ing), through our ears (hearing), and through our fingers (touching). These are three of our chief senses.

Another sense is taste.

This  is a man’s  tongue
These are his lips.
This is his chin.


The chief work of the tongue  is tasting.


.................................................... .


Here is some white powder on a plate.
It may be salt or it may be sugar. Which is it— salt or sugar?

.................................................... .

We get sugar from plants.
We get it from the stems of some plants.

We get sugar from the roots of
some plants.



The salt or sugar which we put in our food is a white powder.



The taste of sugar is sweet.





This is a cake.

It has white sugar on the top.
Cakes with sugar on them are very sweet.

This is an orange.







This is its skin.

Some oranges are sweet. But the taste of their skin is bitter.


.................................................... .


Salt has a salt taste. Sugar has a sweet taste. To the eye salt and sugar seem the same.

But to the tongue they are very different.



Their taste is very different.

Salt




Sugar



What is the work of the nose?
What do we do with our noses?
She has a flower in her hand.
She is smelling the flower.

Some flowers have a sweet smell.
Some flowers have no smell.





This is grass.
These flowers are in a garden.
They have a sweet smell.



.................................................... .

These  are pigs. Some pigs are dirty. Some pigs are clean. (See page 5.)
The smell of dirty pigs is not sweet.
It is a bad smell.

This is smoke.
This is a fire.

Some smoke has a good smell.
The smell may not be sweet, but it may be a good smell.
He is smoking a pipe. Is the smell of the smoke good?

It is blue when it is clear. The color of some clouds is white.
Other clouds are gray.

The sun is yellow.


Sometimes when it is going down

or coming up it is red.




This flame is yellow.



We see things with our eyes.
We see the sizes and colors of things.
Sometimes things seem to our eyes greater or smaller than they are.
They are not what they seem.

This man is tall.




This man is short.



This is a tall woman.


This is a short woman.
.................................................... .

Here are two men.
Do they seem the same size?

Which of them seems taller?
Does the man who is farther seem taller than the man who is nearer? The pictures of them are the same size.
The lines in the picture make the man who is nearer seem shorter.



Seeing, hearing, touch, taste, and smell are “the five senses.”
But we have more than five senses.
Which are some of the other senses?

Our sense of how warm or how cold things are is another.
Here is some cold water with ice in it.
It is very cold.








.................................................... .










Here is some water in a kettle.
The water is boiling. Steam is coming out of the kettle.

Here are three basins. The basin to the right has very warm water in it.
The basin to the left has cold water in it.
The basin in the middle has water which is not cold and not warm in it.



Very	Very
cold	warm


Now I am putting them together into the middle basin where the water is not cold and not warm.

I put my hands in the basins at the sides.
One of my hands is in the cold water; the other is in the warm water.
I keep them there for a time.


.................................................... .

What is this?
This water seems warm to one hand and it seems cold to the other!
It is the same  water.  But it seems cold and warm at the same time!

Why is this?
It is because one hand was in warm water and the other in cold water before I put them in this middle basin.



Another sense is our sense of motion. Here is a seat which goes round and round.

A man is in the seat. He is going round and round...











.................................................... .


At first he has a feeling that he is in motion.
He has the feeling that he is going round.
The seat, with the man in it, keeps on turning round at the same  rate.  It does not go  quicker.
It does not go  slower.

After a time the man has a feeling that he is   not  in motion.
But there is no change in the rate at which  the seat is turning.
It is going round the same number of times a minute.



After a time, if the rate of turning is the same, the man seems to himself to be at rest (not in motion).

He is like all the men and women on the earth. We are all turning round all the time with the earth, but we seem
to ourselves to be at rest.









.................................................... .

We have no feeling that we are in motion.
This is because the rate of turning is the same. The man is in motion. He seems to himself to be at rest.

Here are three boys and a dog.
Two of the boys are taking a rest.
They are resting on their beds.
The other boy and the dog are in motion.



Now, put a stop to the motion of the seat.
When you do that the seat is at rest.
The man is not in motion.

But he has a feeling that he is turning round and round.
This is a picture of his feelings.









.................................................... .


He is not turning round. But he seems to himself to be turning  round.
And everything round him seems to be turning round.
Why is this?

It is because change in our motion is the cause of our feelings of motion.
Through our sense of motion we get
knowledge of changes in the rate and direction of our motion.



What is he doing? He is hammering.




This is his hammer.

Noises and songs are sounds.
What are sounds? They are the effects of waves in the air.

These are waves in a cord.
One end of the cord is fixed to a tree and the boy has the other end. He is shaking it up and down.






These
are waves in the sea.
.................................................... .
As the wave goes down the cord this part, which was up,



With every shake he sends a wave down the cord to the tree.



goes down. And this part,
which was down, goes up.



These are waves in the air.
They come to our ears. They have effects in our ears and brains.
Those effects are sounds.

Here is a brain.
The part of the brain which does the most work in hearing has the word HEARING on it.

She is looking at herself in a looking glass.
Again and again, every day, she takes a look at herself in a glass.

Whenever she sees a looking glass she goes to it and takes a look at herself.








Why?


.................................................... .

Because looking at herself in the glass gives her pleasure.
She is beautiful. She sees that she is beautiful.

Looking at himself in the glass gives him no pleasure.
It gives him pain. Why? He sees himself.
Is he beautiful?



“Pleasure?” What is that? “Pain?” What is that?




Put your finger in the flame.
No, I will not. Why not?
Because of the pain.

Here is a nail.




You put your finger nail over this nail, and I will give it
a blow with this hammer.



.................................................... .


No, you will not.
I see what pain is now. I see what the sense of the word “pain” is now. This is another use of the word “sense.”

That is pain.
Pleasure is the opposite of pain.
“Opposite?” Good is the opposite of bad.



Good weather. The day is bright. The air is warm. The sky is blue. They are happy.

Beautiful things give us pleasure.

When I say that she is beautiful, that gives her pleasure.


 You are beautiful.





When she sees herself in the glass, she sees that she is beautiful.
That gives her pleasure.

There is a smile on her face now.


Why is the smile there?

.................................................... .

It is there because she has a feeling of pleasure. Her pleasure is the cause of her smile.
She is saying to herself, “I am beautiful.”

She is saying to herself that she is beautiful.




A smile does not make a sound.
A laugh makes a sound.



A laugh is a smile with a sound.



This is a great painting by Leonardo.










Its name is the Mona Lisa.

The picture is beautiful. That is certain.







Was the woman beautiful?
Was Lisa herself beautiful?
That is not certain.

.................................................... .

I have my idea of that.









He has his idea.

She had her idea.
We may have different ideas of how beautiful that woman was.
There is no measure of the beautiful.



She may or may not be beautiful.
But it is certain that she has a smile on her lips. That is certain.






It is not certain that she is beautiful.




2 + 2 = 4. Two and two are equal to four. That is certain.


2 + 2 = 5. Two and two are not equal to five. That is certain.

It is certain that 2 + 2 =  4.


.................................................... .
Things which are like one another may be equal or they may not.

a is equal to b, and b is equal to c, and c is equal to d.
So a is equal to d. Things which are equal to the same things are equal to one another.






These two are like one another but they are not equal.



A smile is like a laugh.
But a laugh makes a sound.








This girl is laughing. She is happy.

She has a fall. She gives a cry.









Now she is crying. She is not laughing now. She is crying. Why?


.................................................... .


Because she gave her knee a blow in her fall.

This is her knee.




She was on her feet.
Then she was on her face.
She had a fall.

The fall was the cause of the blow to her knee.


The blow was the cause of the pain in her knee.



And the pain in
her knee was the cause of her crying.



Pleasure and pain are feelings.
We have feelings of pleasure and pain.
Here are some pleasures.

He is on the sand at the seaside, looking at
and hearing the sound of the waves and warming himself in the sun.
These are pleasures.









.................................................... .

Now he is taking a swim in the sea.







He is swimming through the waves.
He is a good swimmer. To a good swimmer, swimming is a pleasure.

Now he is resting in the sun again after his swim.









After the water the sun on his skin is a pleasure to him.



Pleasure and pain are feelings.






When we put our fingers on things we have feelings—feelings of touch or of heat and cold. But this is another use of the word “feeling.”

The man is feeling the bit of wood with his fingers. Is it rough or is it smooth?




This is rough.



This is smooth.


.................................................... .


Things which give us pleasure have an attraction for us.
But it is not the same sort of attraction as the attraction between the earth and the moon. (See pages 82-83.)

Our feeling of this attraction is named “desire.”
When we have pleasure we have a desire for the pleasure to go on and go on...
Time goes on. The hands of the clock go on. Our feelings may or may not go on.



Some desires are stronger than others. This baby sees the cat and he sees his ball.





The cat has an attraction for him.
He has a desire for the cat.

His ball has an attraction for him.
He has a desire for the ball.





Which will he go to?
If his desire for the cat is stronger than his desire for the ball, he will go to the cat.


.................................................... .

He went to the cat. His desire for the cat was stronger.

All our desires are for things which seem good to us.
They may not be good. Our ideas of them may be wrong.



We get knowledge by putting questions.
That is one way of getting knowledge. The answers may give us knowledge or they may not.

When the answers are right, they give us knowledge.
When they are wrong they do not give us knowledge.
2 + 2 = 4	Right
2 + 2 = 5	Wrong







.................................................... .


How far is the sun from the earth?
Which is the right answer:
“It is two miles away” or “it is much more than two miles away?”
Which is the wrong answer to the question?

Which is his right hand?




Which is his left hand? He is facing you.
Now he has his back
to you.


Which is his left hand now, and which is
his right?



Our senses—seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, and smelling— are ways through which we get knowledge.
Our ideas come to us through our senses.

This is a doorway.








The way into the room is through the  door.
The way out of the room is through the  door.



.................................................... .

“Which is the way to the station?”“Take the first street to the right.”








This man had no knowledge of the way to the station. Now he has the knowledge.










The way to the
station

The station



We get knowledge in different ways—through our senses,




through talk with others,

through the work we do with our hands and our heads, and through books.







These are all ways of getting  knowledge.



.................................................... .


Knowledge is very important. It is important in itself. And it is important as a way to other things. A person who  has  no knowledge is of no use to others.

Is the word “use” part of your knowledge of English?
(See page 99.) Knowledge gives us light. It makes things clearer to us.

He will be a man.

Men and women are persons.

.................................................... .


Some seem happier than  others.
All these sorts of things are done by men and women. Things are put and taken by them.
Things are given and got by them. Things are seen and said by them. Things are kept and let go by them. Things are made and sent by them.

We may say this in two ways.
She saw the apple and took it and gave it to Adam.

This may be said in two ways.

A SECOND WORKBOOK OF  ENGLISH




PREFACE
The workbook exercises are graded to confirm and support the sentence sequences from page 2 on of the text. They apply the teaching of vocabulary and structure in simple problem situations which beginners in English can solve, stage by stage, for themselves. They may then check their growing competence by the answers provided.

The workbook should be used without recourse to expla- nation other than the pictures and examples provided, and the text of English Through Pictures Book I, which it follows. Teachers using the materials with classes will get the best results if they refrain from the use of translation and bilingual dictionaries. Simple demonstration of the sentence situations presented in the book can readily be made with the help of objects and pictures. Students can be induced to act out the meaning of what they are saying when they are placed in the carefully designed situations that the text provides. Adequate study of the sentence situations will prepare them to solve these workbook problems with enjoyment, and to discuss them in the English they are learning.

A Journey
Mr. and Mrs. James Grant and their son, Peter, are going on a journey from New York City in New York State to Salt Lake City in Utah. Some time before the journey Mr. Grant said to Mrs. Grant and Peter, “We will go by plane. A plane journey to Salt Lake City takes a very short time.”
　Peter said to his father, “There are horses and cows and sheep and pigs between here and Utah, aren’t there? Do you see them from a plane?”
　“No,” said his father,“the plane goes very high in the air.’’
　Mrs. Grant said,“Going by bus  or train, you
see all the states between New York and Utah and houses and men and women and  boys  and  girls and animals.”


(Pages 2-11)

　“You are right,” said Mr. Grant. “You do see all these things. But it takes a long time to go by bus or  train.”
　“Mother goes on a bus,” said Peter, “when she goes to the store.”
　“But that is a short journey,” his father said.“This will be a long one.”
　“We took a train when we went to Washington, D.C.,” said Peter.“When we were there, you took a picture of me and mother in front of the White House, and a dog came and got in the picture with us.”



　“’Mother and me,’ not ‘me and mother,’ Peter,” said his father.


(Pages 2-11)

　“Yes, you did make a long journey by train when you were five,” Mrs. Grant said. “And now is the time for another. My sister and her family are in Chicago. They are in a new house and have a new baby. We will go and see them. Then we will go to Salt Lake City.”
　“All right,” Mr. Grant said.“We will make our journey in two parts. We will take a plane to Chicago and see your sister’s family. Then we will take the bus which goes from there to Salt Lake City.”
　“Oh good!” said Peter. “We will  go  by  plane and by bus!”

When the Grants were going to their plane, the wind took Mrs. Grant’s hat off her head and up into the air. The hat came down by the side of a building. Mr. Grant went
after it. In a short time he came back with the hat.“It is dirty and a bit wet,” he said.
“Do I see a hole in the hat?” said Mrs. Grant. “Where?” said Mr. Grant.
　“Here,” Mrs. Grant said, putting her finger on the hat. “Oh, I see now. It is dirty, but there is no hole.”
　Mr. Grant gave the hat to Mrs. Grant, saying, “Our plane is here. We have to get on it now. The hat will be dry in a short time.” He took up two of the bags. Mrs. Grant had her hat and another bag in her right hand. Peter put his hand in her left hand, and they went over to the plane.
　After they were in their seats and the plane was in the air, Mrs. Grant went to the washroom at the back of the plane with her hat and her bag. She put the hat,


(Pages 2-11)

which was drying, and the bag to one side. Some of her hairpins were coming out of her hair. She took the other hairpins out, and her hair came down. She took her comb and hair- brush out of the bag. After
brushing and combing her hair, she put it  up  again with the hairpins. She put the comb and  hairbrush back in her bag and then took out another bag in which she had her washcloth. She had no soap with her, but there was some soap in the washroom. She put the washcloth in the warm water in the basin and put soap on it. After washing her face and hands, she put the washcloth in the washcloth bag again. When the wet washcloth was in its bag, it did not make her other things wet.
　By this time Mrs. Grant’s hat was dry. It was a cloth hat. She took a brush and gave the hat a good brushing. In a short time the dirty part of the hat was clean again.

The Grants were in Chicago from Wednesday to Saturday. On Friday Mr. Grant went to the bus station and got three tickets to Salt Lake City. He went to the ticket office and said, “How much are three tickets to Salt Lake City? One is for my son, who is seven.”
　The man said, “Your son’s ticket is $37.40. The other tickets are $74.80.”
　Mr. Grant gave two hundred dollars to the man, and the man gave $13.00 and three tickets to him.
“Is there a bus to Salt Lake City in the morning?” “Yes,” said the man. “One goes at 5:30 and    another
at 10:15.”
“We will take the 10:15 bus,” said Mr. Grant.
“Be here a little before that time,” said the man. “Yes, we will,” said Mr. Grant.“Thank you.”
　On Saturday the Grants took a taxi to the bus station. They got on the bus at 10:05. Peter got a seat by the window. His mother was at his side and his father had a seat in front of them.


(Pages 2-15)


　That day their bus went through a part of two states, Illinois and Iowa. When they got to Des Moines, Iowa, the street lights were on. They went into the bus station for some food. Then they went back to the bus. By this time Peter was ready for bed. His father put down the back of his seat for him. Now the seat was like a bed. His mother put something soft under his head and a coat over him. That is how Peter went to
bed on the bus.
　The Grants were on the bus a part of Saturday and all of Sunday.When they got to Salt Lake City, their friends, Mr. and Mrs. William Price, were at the bus station waiting for them. After shaking hands, Mr. Price said to Mr. Grant, “Please let me have your bags.” Mr. Grant let him take one bag. Then the Prices took the Grants back to their house with them.

This man is writing a letter. He is writing to the editor of the news- paper which he gets. An editor is one of the men who do work for the newspaper. He says what will get into the newspaper. This is what Mr. Penn is writing:




1320 South Street Littleton, Ohio May 16, 2004


The Town Times 45 High Street Littleton, Ohio

Dear Sir:
　I saw the story in your newspaper on what Senator Fillimaster said in Washington. Your paper said that Senator Fillimaster is not right, but I say that he is right. Senator Fillimaster said that there was money in Washington for education. He said, “Let Washington give this money to the states and then the states will give it to the towns. When this money goes to the towns of the United States, all of them will have money
for good buildings and good teachers.”


(Pages 16-25)
　Cities are very great towns. They have money for good school buildings and good teachers. But towns like this one in which we are living do not have much money for education.There are a great number of boys and girls, and the old school buildings will not take them all. Towns like this one put all their money into new school buildings, and there isn’t money for the teachers, who do very hard work. How will we get good teachers when we give them little  money?
　Your newspaper said, “Education is not the work of the men in Washington. When the men in Washington give money to us, the education of our boys and girls will be in their hands. Let Washington keep its money. Education is the work of the towns.”
　Like Senator Fillimaster, I say that this is a question of money, and Washington has the answer. Washington will not keep us from doing the right things with this money. But with little money we will not have good schools or good teachers, and then how will we have good education?

Yours truly, Percival Penn

There! Mr. Penn put his pen down and took up the letter. After reading it over four times, he said,“This is a very good letter. Now I will put it in the letter box.”
　He then put on his hat and coat. He went out of the house and down the front steps to the street. There was a letter box on the other side of the street.
　Before he put the letter into the letter box, he took a look at the front of it. “Oh!” he said. “There is no stamp on this!”
　He went back into the house. He went through all the drawers in his writing table, but there were no stamps.
“Dorothy,” he said,“do you have some stamps?”


(Pages 16-25)

　Mrs. Penn was coming into the room with a postcard in her hand.“There isn’t a stamp in the house,” she said. “Are you going to the post  office?”
　Mr. Penn said, “I wasn’t going, but now I will. Do you have a letter ready for the post?”
　“This is a postcard to our friend, Susan. I put two or three lines on the back of it, saying, ‘We will come and see you on Saturday. Percy sends his love.’”
　“Good,” said Mr. Penn. “I will take it with my letter to the post office and get some  stamps.”
　“Get a hundred,” said Mrs. Penn.“Then we will not be going to the post office every  day.”

On the back page of the newspaper which Mr. Penn got, there was a part for letters like the one which he sent. Two days went by before his letter got into the paper, but, then, there it was with three other letters. He took a good look at it. Yes, the words were the same ones which he put in the letter.
　Two of the other three letters had questions in them. Under these letters there was a short answer from the editor.
　One letter was on the same story of Senator Fillimaster. The man who sent this letter to the news- paper was a Mr. Gordon White. He and Mr. Penn were living on the same street, but not at the same number. They sent their letters to the newspaper on the same day, but they did not say the same thing. Here is Mr. White’s letter:
1851 South Street Littleton, Ohio May 16, 2004 The Town Times 45 High Street Littleton, Ohio Dear Sir, The story in your newspaper on Senator Fillimaster was very good. You are right.

Philip Harrington is a newspaper man writing for a great city paper. His work takes him to different parts of the city and lets him see what is going on there. By questioning persons in the streets he gets together stories for the newspaper and takes or sends them to his office. Reading these stories is the work of another man on the paper. Philip does the work of a reporter and the other man is an editor. That is their work.
　From the windows of the newspaper office, which is high up in a downtown building, one sees the water on a clear day. The city has a great harbor with ships coming in from everywhere. Philip’s editor sent him to the harbor one day to get a story about the men out of work. Dock workers (men who put things on and take them off ships in the harbor) were getting $12.47 an hour at that time and were saying they were not happy. This was not very much for the hard work they did.
　Philip went from one to another of the men on the streets near the harbor, questioning them and their friends and writing down what they said. “We will go



(Pages 16-25)

back to work when we get $13.80 an hour, but not before,” said the men. Philip put this into his story for the paper, and he put other things into it—what other men said of these dock workers who kept ships in harbor and kept others from making journeys which they were ready and waiting to make. He gave a picture of the families of these men out of work. There were different sides to the question and Philip’s story made them clear. When he saw it, the editor put Philip’s story on the front page of the paper and that made Philip very happy.
　Philip Harrington is one of two men who will be sent to Switzerland by their newspaper in a short time. He will be there for three weeks. Men and women from all parts of the earth will be in Switzerland together when the two men are there. Philip will send stories of what these men and women say and do to his editor in the United States. The other man will send pictures. Journeys like this are hard work. Philip will be doing a great part of his writing at night and sending his stories to his editor before morning. In a day or two men and women in the United States will be reading these stories and seeing the pictures of what is going on in Europe.

The earth goes round from east to west. Cities in the East of the United States get the light of the sun before cities in the West. It is 6 a.m. or six in the morning in New York City before it is 6 a.m. in Chicago, and it is 6 a.m. in Chicago before it is 6 a.m. in San  Francisco.
　Let us say that now it is 8 a.m. on Tuesday in New York City. Then it is 7 a.m. in Chicago, 6 a.m. in Denver, and 5 a.m. in San Francisco. The men and women in New York City are going to work, but those in San Francisco will be in bed for another hour or two. The time of day in the two cities is different, but it is the same day.

　There are times when it is not the same day in the two cities. When it is 10 p.m. (ten at night) in San Francisco, it is 11 p.m. on the same day in Denver, 12 at night or 12 midnight, as we say, in Chicago, and 1 a.m. in the morning on Wednesday in New York City. It is Wednesday in New York City before it is Wednesday in San Francisco.
　When a man goes from New York City to Chicago, he will “make” time by putting the hands of the clock back one hour. The day of his journey will be twenty-five hours long. When a person goes from New York City to San Francisco the day of his journey will be twenty- seven hours long. But the day he comes back east will be twenty-one hours.
　Some planes go from New York City to San Francisco in three hours. A person who gets on one of these planes in New York City at 4 p.m. New York time will get off the plane in San Francisco at 4 p.m. San Francisco time! That day will be twenty-seven hours long for him, but it will be twenty-four hours long for us.

Mount Washington is a mountain in the state of New Hampshire. It is 6,288		(feet, miles) high. A person	(map, may) go up this mountain by automobile, by train or on  foot.
　The Carriage Road is for  		 (automobiles, planes). It is eight  			 (miles, yards) long. Going up the mountain  by automobile takes		(about, more) half an hour. Going up by train takes one hour and forty- five	(inches, minutes), and  coming down takes forty-five minutes. The journey down  is
 	 (quick, quicker) than the journey up, but		(slow, slower) than the journey by automobile.
　Walking up Mt. Washington is a  		  (soft, slow) journey. The	(distance, measure) on foot may or may not be greater than by automobile or train, but going on foot takes
 	 (equal, more) time. There are numbers of trails; trails are roads for those who are walking.

　Going up Mt. Washington is  		 (equal, sometimes) like going from summer  into winter. A	(dark, quick) change in  the direction of the wind may make a warm, bright day into a cold, dark one. Sometimes clouds will come down in a minute or two and put a  			 clear, thick) cover over everything. A person may see no more than two		(miles, yards) in front of him. When he gets into the thickest cloud, he may see no more than a number of  			 (inches, distance).
　Walking in the mountains is for persons who have warm clothing, strong shoes, food and a  	  (map, river) with them. One who does not take these things may have a bad time. Some take a  	  (stick, yard) with them.

Changes in transport are going on all the time. Before 1800, men and women made journeys on foot, horse- back, ship, and by carriage, much as others before them did. Through the years, they made better ships and carriages, but the changes were not very  great.
　Great changes in transport came after 1800. First there was the steam engine of James Watt, and then came the steam carriage, the steamship, and the train. After Robert Fulton’s steamship, the Clermont, there were more and more steamships on rivers, and before long, steamships were going over the sea between America and Europe.
　Between 1820 and 1830, there were numbers of steam carriages on the roads of England. These were like horse carriages with no horses. A steam engine made them go. In 1814 George Stephenson made an engine for a train of carriages, four or five or six in line, and in a short time, trains were taking the place of horses and steam carriages.
　Men were making auto- mobiles in Europe and the United States before 1900. By 1913, Henry Ford was putting automobiles onto the roads of the United States in great numbers.  Before  that,  roads


(Pages 61-79)

were opening through the sky. The Wright brothers gave us a new sort of trans- port in 1903 when they went up  in  their  first  airplane.
Airplanes are the quickest sort of transport. Today they go through the air at six hundred miles an hour or more. Now greater changes are taking place than ever before. We are making new sorts of transport—trans- port which takes off from our earth for greater and greater distances. By the year 2050, great numbers of us  may  be  making  journeys  to  the  moon  and other
places far from the earth.
You will give answers to these questions:
1. What changes in transport came between 1800 and 1900?
The changes in transport which	  came between 1800 and 1900	  were the steam carriage, the	  steamship, and the train.

“Our street is	(equal, changing). It is getting more and more buildings on it. It is getting
 	 (ever, full) of buildings,” said David Martin.“The day will come when the tall buildings round us will keep the sunlight from coming in the windows and it will be	(bright, dark) all day long in here.”
　Mary Martin went over to the window by David and took a look at the new building going up on the other side of the street.
“Let’s get a place with three
or four rooms in a building which is very high. Then we’ll have sunlight some part of the day,” she said. “High up in the building there is more light and    air and the rooms are	(brighter, darker).”
　“But the	(price, why) of places like that is as high as the building it is in and we do not have enough money for it. Let’s go somewhere where there is some		(land, more) round a little house. Then we will get enough sunlight and we will not see buildings in every  direction.”

　“Yes,	(sometimes, why) don’t we?” said Mary.
　They got into their automobile and went to the office of a friend, who said to them,“I have the right house for you. Come and see it.”
　He took them four miles out of town. There they saw a new little house with some land round it. There were trees between the house and the other houses.
　“Did you	(about, ever) see a better house?” said David to Mary.
 “No, I never did,” said Mary.“But how much is it?” The price didn’t make David very happy. But the man said to him,“By putting a little money down for
the house now, you may go right into it. It will be your house. After that, the money which you put out every month will be no more than what you are giving for the place where you are living now.”
“Good,” said David.“That is what we will do.”

This animal is a bat. It is able to go through the air not only in the daytime but at night as well, when there is
no light at all. How does it do this and keep clear of trees and houses? We didn’t have the answer to this question before 1793. Then a man by the name of Spallanzani got the idea that it was not the bats’ eyes but their ears that made them able to go about in the dark. To see if this was true, he took the sense of hearing from a number of bats. When he did this, the bats were not able to keep from going into things. This made it clear that their hearing was the most impor- tant sense to bats in motion. But others at that time gave no thought to what Spallanzani said. It took years for others to see that his statements about bats’ hearing were true.
　Bats make thin, high, short noises, sending sound waves through the air which may be turned back by a tree or a wall or anything in front of them. Sound waves coming back to the bat’s ear give the bat knowledge of when something is in front of it and how far away the thing is.


(Pages 129-149)

　As a bat gets nearer to what is in its way, the sound waves the bat sends out come back to it more quickly. Then the bat makes a change in its direction. This is how it keeps clear of things, on the darkest nights as well as on the brightest days.

It was a warm summer day. After working hard in his garden, Mr. Wood was resting in his bedroom when a very loud hammering noise came through an open window.“What on earth is that!” he said. The noise was coming from a bird which was making a hole in a tree not far from the window. ‘Oh, no!” said Mr. Wood when it became clear to him what the noise was. But he didn’t get up at first.Waiting for the bird to get through seemed the only thing to do. However, the hammering kept on. At last Mr. Wood, with his eyes only half open, got up and said to himself, “I’m going to put a stop to that noise!” He went over to the window and put it down very hard, making a noise louder than the hammering of the bird. “Oh, what did I do!” said Mr. Wood, seeing bits of glass and wood on the floor round him. “The window is broken now. And all because of that bird!” After a short time there was again the sound of hammering.Was it the bird? No, this time it was Mr. Wood himself, putting the parts of the window frame together  again.
